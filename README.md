# Research Paper Finder 🕵️‍♂️📚

Welcome to the **Research Paper Finder**! 🎉 This project was a daring quest to conquer the wilds of arXiv and help you find research papers with the elegance of a caffeinated librarian. My aim? To make your research journey smoother than a freshly brewed cup of coffee.

## What’s the Scoop? 🍦

In a world where searching for research papers can be as confusing as a labyrinth, our hero (this app) was created to save the day! With a simple input, it was supposed to fetch you the top relevant research papers from arXiv for your topic, making you feel like a research rockstar.

## Mission Partially Accomplished 🥲

While I intrepid app made valiant efforts, it’s not quite the research-finding wizard I hoped for. Instead, it became more of a “meh, I found some papers” tool. So, while it didn’t quite find the Holy Grail of research papers, it did serve its purpose of being a playful experiment in app deployment.

## Why the Fuss? 🤔

This project was not just about finding papers—it was also an adventure into the land of app deployment with Vercel. The goal? To deploy apps faster than you can say "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." 🏃‍♂️💨 Spoiler alert: I did get pretty quick at deploying, but my app's search prowess is still a work in progress.

## How It Works 🚀

1. **Input:** Type your research topic. No need to impress us with your typing speed—just don’t leave it blank!
2. **Search:** Hit that shiny “Search” button and let the app do its thing.
3. **Results:** See the list of papers. If "Attention Is All You Need" isn’t at the top, don’t worry, it’s probably just taking a nap.

## Features (or Lack Thereof) ⚙️

- **Search for Papers:** Type in a topic and hope for the best.
- **Sort Results:** Choose between sorting by year or relevance. Although, sorting by relevance might occasionally feel like a roll of the dice.

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-paper-finder.git
   ```
2. **Deploy to Vercel**
3. **You're done**

## Acknowledgments 🙌

A huge shoutout to Vercel (https://vercel.com/) for making deployment as smooth as a buttered pancake. And of course, to arXiv for the treasure trove of research papers, even if they occasionally like to play hide and seek.
